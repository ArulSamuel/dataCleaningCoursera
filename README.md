# Getting and Cleaning Data : Data Wrangling

## Outline 
To learn the concepts of data wrangling by working on a course project to convert the raw data into tidy data suitable for further analysis.

## Objective 
To clean the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometer data (UCI HAR Dataset) obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and present it in a neat and tidy format.

## Process 
The link contains further information to how the raw data has been collected, structured and present valuable information about the study design for the data.

I performed the following operations 
1. download the dataset from the link
2. extracted it to the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset'
3. wrote a script data_tidy.R to clean the data.
4. added a cookbook file 'dataCookBook.md' (which explains the data transformations)
5. added my understanding of the process in the Readme.md file

This is an academic project done to understand the concepts from the coursera 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course as part of the Data Science Specialization.
